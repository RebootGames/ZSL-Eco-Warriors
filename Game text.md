## In-Game Facts

Arctic Tundra

Step 5 fact: In the UK natural gas has almost run out, so it is imported from further away

Step 7 fact: 10% of electricity wasted along metal pylons

Step 8 fact: 9-16% of the electricity consumed in homes is used to power devices left on standby

Any time fact: The Arctic is estimated to hold the world's largest remaining untapped gas reserves

Any time fact: Permafrost is the frozen layer of soil in the ground of the tundra which is melting as a result of climate change

Any time fact: Melted water and rainfall to soak right through the soil so there is less water sources for the animals

Any time fact: Some scientists believe that at this rate the Arctic could be ice-free by 2030 or even earlier!

Ocean

Step 12 fact: Methane is 23 times more harmful to the environment than carbon
Any time fact: London alone drinks 2 million plastic bottles of water daily (and that’s just water!)
Any time fact: Warming of the seas is causing animal to move to cooler waters, and coral bleaching
Any time fact: More CO2 is being absorbed by the ocean and a chemical reaction occurs, making the ocean more acidic
Any time fact: Acidic oceans are less saturated with calcium carbonate, which is used to produce/maintain shells of crabs, mussels and clams


Rainforest

Step 1 fact: Mining takes place in, and destroys rainforests

Step 1 fact: When trees are cut down the carbon they store is released into the atmosphere

Step 9 fact: 80% of the carbon footprint of a phone happened before it’s turned on for the first time

Any time fact: Temperatures increasing and a lack of rainfall cause a drought 

Any time fact: The drought causes forest fires, and the burning of the trees releases more carbon into the atmosphere

British Countryside

Step 2 fact: Carbon is also released when electricity is generated to produce pesticides

Step 3 fact: Nitrous oxide is 300 times more harmful to the environment than carbon

Step 6 fact: Methane is 23 times more harmful to the environment than carbon

Step 10 fact: Sometimes beef is flown over from a different country

Any time fact: 2.1 million cattle are used for food annually in the UK

Any time fact: In 2015, overall UK agriculture released an estimated 49.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere

Any time fact: If the same level of greenhouse gases are emitted this century, there could be up to 1.9m rise in sea levels

Any time fact: A 1m rise in sea level would see most of Bangladesh, Vietnam, Norway and the Maldives underwater
