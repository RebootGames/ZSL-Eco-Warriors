# ZSL-Eco-Warriors
## Critical Reasoning on the ZSL project
#### The reasons on why we first chose to do this project was because that we wanted to expand our mindset on other types of software and to expand our knowledge on how clients would specificly like their type of game to look like. This gave us good experience which can be used in future projects with other clients as we will understand much better than before. This porject with ZSL was also done on IOS which was a slight push back as it had a few restraints on our work as some parts of the game would have been inaccessable. The reason it was done on IOS also is that the ZSL clients only had IOS devices to support the game on which was a challenge but we knew how to overcome that later on. This had to be on a mobile app because ZSL wanted the game to be used easily and so that the audience would understand it much faster than using computers or other devices. Also this had to be on a mobile device because the only devices they had to have the game running was those. This device was also good for the audience which was for 11-16 year olds which would understand how to use them much easier than other certain devices. Doing this project on this device means that other people who are not visiting any of the ZSL zoo's and are just visiting the website would be able to access this game on their tablets or mobile phones or even on their PC which will allow them to try it out also. This can be used for teachers in schools which they can use for their students to go through the game to help them learn about the greenhouse gas chain. The audience for this project was for 11-16 year olds this was because if school attended one of these zoo's they would also have an experience in doing this game within the zoo. One of the staff members would have one of the classes to try out the game and to test their knowledge on this subject. This project was all about the environment and greenhouse gases, the reason why was because the idea of the game was to look at how the world is becoming polluted by the certain types of industries. So the project had to be about the four habitats which was the countryside, the tundra, the ocean and the rainforest. These four habitats have certain industries destroying the landscape and creating pollution. So this had to be shown to the children to show them what can be done to stop this type of destruction.


## Group Roles and Shared Targets: 
#### 1. Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.
#### 2. Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 3. Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 4. Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
#### 5. Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.

#### One of the main targets we all had was the completion of the game itself but also some of the smaller targets we had was on deciding on some of the game designs and gameplay of the game itself.

## Tools and Techniques
## Tools
### Photoshop
#### Photoshop was used in our project to create the characters that the player would choose at the beginning of the game which will represent them for the rest of the game. We also used Photoshop to edit some of the background ont he four habitats and some of assets that were used in the game. This saved us some money instead of buying everything from the web which some were quite expensive. We also used Photoshop to create the maze in are first prototype of our game. 

### Github
#### We used Github quite a lot to have most of our documentation shared between all of us so when we are not in class this can be uploaded and used by our whole group at home to then also modify it. This helped to keep backup of our work so that incase it was lost on someones drive then we knew there is a backup on Github. 

### Unity
#### Unity was a huge help to us as it was used to create the application. Unity was one of the best choices to use as it had functions which allowed multiple members of the group modify parts of the game and then shared between everyone in the group. This helped complete the application in a much faster pace as multiple members were involved in the process. It was a very easy to use tool and has a huge range of assets that could have been used.

### PowerPoint
#### PowerPoint was only used for our presentations, this was to present our concept designs and ideas that we thought of on one of the first pitch meetings we had with the ZSL representatives. This was also used to show the final look and design on PowerPoint. We showed are finished design and how we adapted to feedback. The reason we used PowerPoint was that it is the simplest and best presentation software out there. We also used PowerPoint online so all four of us could work on different slides for the certain parts of work that each person did.

## Techniques
### Interviews
#### Multiple interviews with ZSL. The first one was with a ZSL representative Michelle who came in to explain the project that she wanted for us to work on. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the PowerPoint she used to present out some of the information. The other interviews we had was when we presented our concept designs and ideas and then the final interview which was showing the completion of the whole game. 

### Prototyping
#### Prototyping was used when creating different variations of the game that we wanted in Unity which we also tested after doing each section of the prototypes. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the Power Point she had. This also helped us in checking whether this idea will work and how long does it take to make it successful. 

### Presentations
#### We presented are game in a presentation as it is easy to get your points across and it captures peopleâ€™s attention when you are standing at the front of the room and have your presentation behind you. You can also use your body language and speaking skills to help present your work and get it across

## First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
#### The first time we met the client was on the 2nd of October, a representative from ZSL came into the college to give a presentation on what they roughly want within the game. This included some of the requirements that had to be within the game, such as what the game should look like, the genre of the game, target audience and how much time there given to complete the whole game.

### Problems to Solve
#### The first thing that we encountered on the specifications was that the game had to be used on IOS tablets which means that it will be not that flexible in making it into an app so it had to be done on a web browser through the IOS tablets. Secondly the time spectrum was not very long so we know we had to work as hard as we can to complete it. The genre was of course about the environment and it had to be based on four habitats so this slightly simplified the work load. So this gave us a foundation to start the game on but another problem was that the audience is 11-16 year olds but slightly focused on 11-12 more. This was slightly difficult to compose our ideas relatable to that age range.

### Time Allocated 
#### We have 15 days from the first meeting to come up with a concept idea to present to the ZSL representatives. For this we have allocated a time frame of 12 days to come up with a concept pitch, this then allows us 3 days extra just incase a problem occurs such as a team member not being present or if a design change is agreed upon.

#### The first 7 days were dedicated on coming up with our game concept. This will include in creating concept art that we can show the client so that they can have a clear picture of what we intend to make. The end game result will be decided aswell, how the player will interact with the game and how the information will be conveyed to the player. This should take some time as planning and getting ideas together is important for the whole structure of the game.

#### The next 8 days will be used to finalise any of the work that has been decided on and starting to create the concept pitch presentation that we will be giving to the client on the 17th. More time has been given to this task as we want to make the presentation as professional as possible and so that all other tasks are up to date.

## Preparation
#### In order to prepare for the final pitch our team will need to divide the work up evenly between the 4 of us. This is how we decided to divide the work.

### Matthew and Daniel (Powerpoint)
#### Matthew and Codrin will be in charge of creating the PowerPoint presentation which will include all of the concept art that will be used within the game. Daniel will be focused more on the creating the concept art that will be presented whilst Matthew will be focusing on adding in all the neccessary information that will explaing all the features that will be in the application. 2 members of the group were put to this task as we knew that PowerPoint is the main asset that will be showing all the work we have put together to create the app, so we wanted to make sure it was completed on time and to a high standard.

### Bec(Handouts)
#### Bec will be responsible for creating the handouts that will be given to the ZSL representatives that will be present at the pitch. In these handouts they will include the same information that will be on the PowerPoint presentation but will also have some extra detailed information as the PowerPoint which only have points in that will be expanded on whilst the handout will have all of the info within in. Bec will be working closely to Matthew and Codrin so that the handouts and the PowerPoint have the same informaiton.

### Oliver and Codrin(Script/Notes)
#### Olvier and Codrin will be creating the script and notes that will be used during the presentation. This will be important so that the notes can help if the person presenting will get stuck on a point that is vital for the audience to know about it. For this they will have to work with Matthew to make sure the points and notes are connected. 

## Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
#### On the 17th of October, we went to whipsnade zoo to deliver our concept pitch and some ideas that we thought of to include within the game we designed. For this we created a powerpoint presentation that showed the features that the app will have and how it would look to the audience. Concept art will be included of the main menu and some of the in-game scenes.

### Problems to Solve
#### We already created a contingency plan if the presentation does not work correctly so we printed out handouts of what the presentation would look like incase if it does not load up correctly which will be given to the ZSL representatives. Back-ups were also done on multiple USB drives so that it one gets corrupeted or the the file does not load then we will have access to another copy. 

#### Some of the ideas we had presented were slightly of course of what the representatives visualised but in this it helped us understand more of what they imagined it would look like. The feedback was very useful as we were unsure on some minor parts of the game. But this set us back on track with exactly what had to be done for the client to aprove it. 

## Final Meeting (Deadline 7th November 2017)
#### As we had everything ready for the pitch to show the amount of effort we have put into the game and to make it suit the needs of the audience and of the clients vision of how it would look like. So we also prepared backups on multiple USb drives if our presentation fails and so we know we have a spare. Also we have the game available to use on some tablets which we have brought ourselves so that it can be used by the judges to see how it feels for them and whether they like how the whole game works itself. 
#### Unfortunately our group did not get chosen out of the other groups that were there but we found out that we were the runners up and thought that our idea was very good and it very well made overall but had a hard decision between the two. 

## Conclusion 
#### Overall in my opinion thw whole team work well together as we combined ideas and suggestions that might make the game better or more appealing to the audience. We had a few problems on some parts but worked it out in the end as team always helped one another out if they were stuck on something that they couldn't get their head around. It was a good expereince and challenge especially in the short amount of time given and would love to try another some time soon.
