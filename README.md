### Analysis of the Research (Meeting With Client and Student Survey)
#### Noted feedback from the client:
 #### * Application was too complex
 #### * Application was too game focused insteand of giving information
 #### * Application wasn't showing the importance of gas meter.

#### So we've got it wrong from the beginning, but we've managed to remake our application to repair our mistakes. We've focused on giving the player information while he was having fun and displaying how the gas meter affects the entire world.
