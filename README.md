# ZSL-Eco-Warriors
## Critical Reasoning on the ZSL project
#### The reasons on why we first chose to do this project was because that we wanted to expand our mindset on other types of software and to expand our knowledge on how clients would specificly like their type of game to look like. This gave us good experience which can be used in future projects with other clients as we will understand much better than before. This porject with ZSL was also done on IOS which was a slight push back as it had a few restraints on our work as some parts of the game would have been inaccessable. The reason it was done on IOS also is that the ZSL clients only had IOS devices to support the game on which was a challenge but we knew how to overcome that later on. This had to be on a mobile app because ZSL wanted the game to be used easily and so that the audience would understand it much faster than using computers or other devices. Also this had to be on a mobile device because the only devices they had to have the game running was those. This device was also good for the audience which was for 11-16 year olds which would understand how to use them much easier than other certain devices. Doing this project on this device means that other people who are not visiting any of the ZSL zoo's and are just visiting the website would be able to access this game on their tablets or mobile phones or even on their PC which will allow them to try it out also. This can be used for teachers in schools which they can use for their students to go through the game to help them learn about the greenhouse gas chain. The audience for this project was for 11-16 year olds this was because if school attended one of these zoo's they would also have an experience in doing this game within the zoo. One of the staff members would have one of the classes to try out the game and to test their knowledge on this subject. This project was all about the environment and greenhouse gases, the reason why was because the idea of the game was to look at how the world is becoming polluted by the certain types of industries. So the project had to be about the four habitats which was the countryside, the tundra, the ocean and the rainforest. These four habitats have certain industries destroying the landscape and creating pollution. So this had to be shown to the children to show them what can be done to stop this type of destruction.


## Group Roles and Shared Targets: 
#### 1. Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.
#### 2. Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 3. Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 4. Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
#### 5. Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.

#### One of the main targets we all had was the completion of the game itself but also some of the smaller targets we had was on deciding on some of the game designs and gameplay of the game itself.

## First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
#### The first time we met the client was on the 2nd of October, a representative from ZSL came into the college to give a presentation on what they roughly want within the game. This included some of the requirements that had to be within the game, such as what the game should look like, the genre of the game, target audience and how much time there given to complete the whole game.

You need to describe how and when you met with the client. How you wrote the requirements, how and why you changed your project specifications 
### Problems to Solve
#### The first thing that we encountered on the specifications was that the game had to be used on IOS tablets which means that it will be not that flexible in making it into an app so it had to be done on a web browser through the IOS tablets. Secondly the time spectrum was not very long so we know we had to work as hard as we can to complete it. The genre was of course about the environment and it had to be based on four habitats so this slightly simplified the work load. So this gave us a foundation to start the game on but another problem was that the audience is 11-16 year olds but slightly focused on 11-12 more. This was slightly difficult to compose our ideas relatable to that age range.

## Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
#### On the 17th of October, we went to whipsnade zoo to deliver our concept pitch and some ideas that we thought of to include within the game we designed. For this we created a powerpoint presentation that showed the features that the app will have and how it would look to the audience. Concept art will be included of the main menu and some of the in-game scenes.

### Problems to Solve
#### We already created a contingency plan if the presentation does not work correctly so we printed out handouts of what the presentation would look like incase if it does not load up correctly which will be given to the ZSL representatives. Back-ups were also done on multiple USB drives so that it one gets corrupeted or the the file does not load then we will have access to another copy. 
#### Some of the ideas we had presented were slightly of course of what the representatives visualised but in this it helped us understand more of what they imagined it would look like.  



We will also have with us back-ups of our presentation on multiple USB drives so that if one gets corrupted or the USB itself is lost or damaged, we will still have access to a copy. We have online back-ups also, however we cannot guarantee internet access at the pitch so a local copy was deemed necessary.

Time Alloted
We have 15 days from the first client meeting to come up with our game idea and create a presentation to give to the client. For this we have allocated a time frame of 10 days to complete these tasks, this is to allow for 5 days extra incase something goes wrong (e.g. personal illness of a team memeber) so that we do not miss the deadline.

The first 4 days will be dedicated to coming up with our game concept. This will include us creating concept art that we can show the client so that they can have a clear picture of what we intend to make. We will need to decide on the goal of the game, how the player will interact with the game and how the information will be conveyed to the player. We expect this to take less time than creating the presentation itself so we have allocated less time to the concept phase

The next 6 days will be used to create the presentation that we will be giving to the client on the 17th of October. We have allocated more time to this as we want to make the presentation as professional as possible. We will also need to create contingency plans incase something goes wrong during the presentation, such as a computer crash, so that we can contiue to present without a powerpoint. For these reasons we have given ourselves more time to complete all of these things.

For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

Preparation
In order to prepare for this pitch our team will need to divide the work up evenly between the 4 of us. This is how we decided to divide the work.

Sam and Ryan (Powerpoint)
Sam and Ryan will be responsible for creating the powerpoint and the concept art that will be included in the presentation. Sam will be focusing more on creating the concept art and Ryan will be more focused on adding the informtaion on features to the powerpoint. We decided to put 2 of us to work on this because the powerpoint is the main asset we will need during the pitch so we wanted to make sure it was completed on time and to a high standard.

George (Handouts)
George will be responsible for creating the handouts that will be given to the members of ZSL present at the pitch. The handouts will need to include the same information as on the powerpoint but more condensed as to fit on no more than 2 A4 pages. To make sure the information is the same. George will still be working closely with Ryan as he is the one writing the information for the powerpoint.

Myself (Script/Notes)
I will be responsible for creating notes for me to use when I give the presentation. For this I will need to work with Ryan to make sure that what I talk about is included in the powerpoint and vice versa. While I wont be having a full script to read from during the presentation, we felt it good to make a script so that I have a memory of what to talk about along side the notes.
